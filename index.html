        <p>As i write this, my eyes automatically roll over to the smiley above. I feel <i>different</i>. So, I
            pause, lift my hands off the keyboard and look at myself in the mirror.<mark>I'm smiling</mark>.</p>

        <p><b>The Smile</b> An involuntary response to an emoticon - make me ponder how simple things in life
            can transform one's thoughts, feelings and mental experience. thus, i researched what it is
            within a smile that made me feeling "different". So, when I happened to read an
            <mark>article</mark>by Nicole Spector about how smiling can trick one's brain into happiness, i
            felt <I>different</I> yet again.
        </p>

        <p>First, the article argues that happiness is not a prerequisite to smiling; in fact,smiling can be
            used as a tool to generate happieness. if one smiles, the brain assume that</p>
        <p>there <i>must</i>have been an amusing event that triggered the responce. However, the brain does
            not.To put it in Spector's words,<mark>"the brain is a sucker for grin"</mark> and it does not
            care whether one is genuinely smiling or just faking it.Spector corroborates this with credible
            studies.For exp, at the university of Cardiff in wales,researches found that people who were
            unable to frown due to botox injections were happier than the normal ones who could frown. This
            only proves that the brain does not need a 'reason' for smiling.</p>

        <p>The second cornerstone of this article talks about why a smile is contagious, just like a yawn.
            <b> reason:</b> mirror neurons. At a mechanical level,mirror neurons enable one to reflect the
            other's behavior. Hence, when one smiles,another person sees the smike and cannot help but also
            smile. This means that mirror neurons were immediately triggered and the person smiled.At a
            deeper emotional level,one reciprocates the smile because she feels endered and recieve positive
            vibrations, both of which one would want to pass on to others.
        </p>
        <p>The reson i found this article highly engrossing is simple: My New Year's Resolution is to 
            <i>Smile often</i></p>
        <p>As a collage student constantly playing catch-up with deadline,classes and activities,I wanted to
            ensure not to compromise on my happiness.Hence,the most time-efficient method i found was to
            smile-a simple route to keeping myself flushed with <mark>"happy hormones."</mark> This article
            taught me the distinction between happiness's prerequisites and its after-effects. Thus, having
            learned that smiling<i>is</i>a prerequisite to 'instant happiness',I've strengthened my resolve
            to smile more often.Also, I was thrilled to learn that smiling is contagious.Thus,whenever I
            happen to walk on any street,I will <i>smile.</i></p>
        <p>Smiling is simple for it only takes 26 muscles; yet,it's unimaginably hard to do every day.After
            having read this articke, i'm more confident of my resolve and thus,will continue to smile with
            a greater enthusiasm till smiling itself becomes my default state.</p>

            <h1>The Power of a Smile</h1>
            <p>The smile is a universal sign of happiness.I believe it is the ultimate connection between
                all humankind.No matter how big or small,if a smile is genuine it creates an ineffable
                feeling in the atmosphere.I believe in the atmosphere. I believe in the power of a smile to
                make the saddest of circumstances a little better.I believein the power of a smile to enrich
                the happiest experiences in life. I believe in the power of smile to transcend all barriers
                between individuals and to create special moments in life</p>
